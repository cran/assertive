parenthesise(x, type = c("round_brackets", "square_brackets",
  "curly_brackets", "angle_brackets", "chevrons", "hyphens", "en_dashes",

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Character vector to wrap in parenthenses.}

\item{type}{String naming the type of parenthesis.}
}
\value{

}
\description{
Parenthesise a character vector by wrapping elements in brackets,
dashes or commas.
}
\note{
English grammar terminology is awfully confusing.  The verb 'to
parenthesise' means to wrap a phrase in brackets or dashes or commas,
thus denoting it as supplementary material that could be left out.
A 'parenthesis' as a noun is often used as a synonym for a round bracket.
